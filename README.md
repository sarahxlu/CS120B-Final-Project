the first 2 songs: 1. Jingle Bells and 2. Mario Theme. By pressing the A4 button, the screen will display 
the last song which is 3 Happy Birthday and pressing the A3 button will return back to the first 2 songs.The user 
can choose the songs currently displayed on the screen by pressing the buttons associated with the songs. For example, 
button A0 is associated with song 1 Jingle Bells. The name of the song being played will appear on the LCD for the
entire duration of the song and the LEDs will blink with the beat. When a song is playing, pressing button A0 will 
pause the song and pressing it again continues the song. Pressing button A1 while a song is playing will stop the 
song and the LCD will return to the main menu. Pressing button A3 and A4 while a song is playing will go back to the 
previous song or skip to the next song respectively.
